                    ## Make a story
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    As the first line, use this code:

                    ```
                    ask who is the star in your story?
                    ```

                    After that first line, start with `print` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `echo` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    ask The main character of this story is
                    print The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    echo He's a bit scared, 
                    print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    print He's afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```

                start_code: "print Your story starts here"
            2:

                    ## Story
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    name is ask What is the name of the main character?
                    print name is now going to run in the woods
                    print name is a bit scared
                    print Suddenly he hears a crazy noise...
                    sleep
                    print name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    print name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly...'
                    ```

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can use the for command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    print 'brown bear'
                    print 'brown bear'
                    print 'What do you see?'
                    for animal in animals
                        print 'I see a ' animal ' looking at me'
                        print animal
                        print animal
                        print 'What do you see?'
                    print 'I see all the animals looking at me!'
                    ```

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can use nesting to put if, repeat or for commands inside other if, repeat or for commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.

                    ## Example Simple Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = ask 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    if location is shop
                        print 'She enters the shop.'
                        print 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = ask 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        if book is yes
                            print 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        else
                            print 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    else
                        print 'Robin goes home'
                    ```

                    ## More elaborate
                    The example above is pretty straightforward, but with nesting you can really elaborate your code and turn your story into a real game. Check out this example!

                    ## Elaborate code
                    ```
                    sword = lost
                    game = on
                    print 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    print 'The path splits two ways'
                    repeat 2 times
                        if game is on
                            path = ask 'Which path should she choose?'
                            if path is left
                                if sword is found
                                    print 'Our hero comes across a dragon!'
                                    print 'Luckily our hero has a sword to defeat the beast!'
                                    game = over
                                else
                                    print 'Our hero finds a dragon, but she doesnt have any weapons!'
                                    print 'Our hero is beaten by the dragon...'
                                    print 'Try again'
                                    game = over
                            if path is right
                                if sword is lost
                                    print 'Our hero finds a sword'
                                    print 'This could come in very handy'
                                    sword = found
                                else
                                    print 'You have already found the sword. There is nothing left here.'
                                    print 'She walks back'
                    ```

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your if commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = ask 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    if end is happy
                        print 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        print 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        print 'ZAP!'
                        print 'They are back in their garage'
                    else
                        print 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        print 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        print 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!'
                    ```

                    ## Story
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `repeat`.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    repeat 5 times print 'Help!'
                    print 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```

                start_code: "repeat 5 times print 'Help!'"
            5:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `if`, and then you have already made a whole program!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name is ask Who is walking in the forest?
                    print name 'walks through the forest'
                    print name 'encounter a monster'
                    end is ask Would you like a good or a bad ending?
                    if end is good print name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    else print 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Here your story will start!'"
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story
                    You may have noticed that there is still a problem in the previous levels. Did you try to print a sentence that contained the word name?
                    You can solve that in this level. You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name is Hans
                    print 'The name of the main character is' name
                    print name 'is now going to walk in the woods'
                    print name 'is a bit scared'
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    print 'He hears the sound of an' animals at random
                    print name 'is afraid this is a haunted forest'
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Your story will be printed here!'"
            3:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story
                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can also add something random to your story. Any monster, animal or other obstacle.

                    It goes like this:
                    ```
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    print He now hears the sound of an animals at random
                    ```

                    The command `add` can also come in handy in your story. For example:
                    ```
                    print He hears a sound
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    animal is ask What do you think it is?
                    add animal to animals
                    print it was a animals at random
                    ```

                    This is an example of the `remove` command in your story
                    ```
                    print His backpack got way too heavy.
                    print Inside were a bottle of water, a flashlight and a brick.
                    bag is water, flashlight, brick
                    dump is ask Which item should he dump?
                    remove dump from bag
                    ```
                start_code: "print Your story"
            15:

                    ## Story
                    Using the `while` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `while game is 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `while sword is 'lost'` so the player can't continu the game until they have found something.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    keys = 'lost'
                    print 'You are standing in your garden and you have lost your keys.'
                    print 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    print 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'
                    while keys == 'lost'
                        location = ask 'Where do you want to look?'

                    ## Story
                    By using the `and` and `or` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.

                    In this level you can easily make the childrens' song 'Five little monkeys'. Can you make the last chorus?
                    You can also make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!
                    Or you can make Old McDonald with all the different animals.

                    ## Songs
                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    repeat 99 times
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                        print verse ' bottles of beer'
                        print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                        verse = verse - 1

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `repeat`! Can you finish the code?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    repeat _ _ print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    print 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.
                start_code: "print 'Baby Shark'"

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    print verse ' bottles of beer'
                    print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 1 you can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or a stair!

                    Using `forward` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `turn right` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `turn left` turns counter clockwise.

                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    turn right
                    forward 50
                    turn left
                    forward 50
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    print Drawing figures
                    angle is 90
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle
                    forward 25

                    ## Searching turtle
                    In this level you can use use `random` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `at random` to choose a value from a list. You can copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    angles is 10, 50, 90, 150, 250

                    In level 5 you can make a choice with `if`. For example between different types of figures.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'Drawing Figures'
                    figure is ask 'Do you want a square or a triangle?'
                    if figure is triangle angle is 120
                    else angle is 90
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    print 'Drawing Figures'
                    figure is ask 'Do you want a square or a triangle?'
                    if figure is triangle angle is 120 else angle is 90
                    turn angle
                    forward 25

                    ## Let's draw
                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `repeat`.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    angle = 90
                    repeat 10 times
                        turn angle
                        forward 50
                    ```

                    ## Interaction
                    Also, we can now improve the program that draws different figures.
                    Can you figure out how far the turtle has to turn here? Finish the code and you can draw any polygon you'd like!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    angles = ask 'How many angles should I draw?'
                    angle = 360 / angles
                    repeat angle times
                        turn _
                        forward _
                    ```
                start_code: |

                    ## Let's draw
                    In this level you can repeat one line of code with `repeat`.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ## Let's draw
                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    angles = ask 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle = 360 / angles
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle

                    ## Dishwashing
                    In this level you could make an even better dish washing shedule.

                    ## Hedy code example
                    ```
                    days = Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
                    names = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    for day in days
                        print names at random ' does the dishes on ' day
                    ```

                    ## Dishwashing
                    With the `repeat` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for the entire week.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    repeat _ _ print 'the dishwasher is' _
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"
            6:
                story_text: |
                    ## Dishwashing
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people at random
                    print 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    if dishwasher is Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    print 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?

                    ## Make it fair
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `remove` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher = people at random
                    print 'Monday the dishes are done by: ' dishwasher
                    remove dishwasher from people
                    dishwasher = people at random
                    print 'Tuesday the dishes are done by: ' dishwasher
                    remove dishwasher from people
                    dishwasher = people at random
                    ```

                start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"

                    ## Dishwashing
                    With the `if` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```

                    dishwasher is people at random
                    if dishwasher is Sophie print _ too bad I have to do the dishes _ else print 'luckily no dishes because' _ 'is already washing up'

                    Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?
                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in this level!
                    You first make a list of the members of your family. Then choose 'at random' from the list.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```

                    You can also make a die again in level 5. With the `repeat` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.
                    Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                    But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    repeat _ _ print _ _ _

                    ## Dice
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in this, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices at random
                    print 'you threw' throw
                    if throw is earthworm points = points + 5 else points = points + throw
                    print 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.

                    ## Looking forward

                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.

                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    ## Rock, paper, scissors
                    In level 1 you can start with a rock, paper, scissors  game.

                    With `ask` you can make a choice, and with `echo` you can repeat that choice.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    print what do you choose?
                    ask choose from rock, paper or scissors
                    echo so your choice was:

                    In this level we can determine who won.
                    For that you need the new `if` code.

                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                    Then you can use `if` to see if they are the same or different.
                    Will you finish the code?

                    Now that you can calculate, you can also create a program to practice maths calculations. You can make up the calculations yourself, for example:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    correct_answer = 11 * 27

                    else print 'Wrong! It was ' correct_answer
                    ```

                    ## Random numbers
                    You can also let the computer do random sums on its own using random.
                    This is how you choose a number of tables to practice, and from that you always get a different sum:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    tables = 4, 5, 6, 8
                    numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
                    table = tables at random
                    number = numbers at random
                    correct_answer = table * number
                    answer = ask 'how much is ' table ' times ' number '?'
                    if answer is correct_answer print 'okay'
                    else print 'mistake! it was ' correct_answer

                      ```
                     print Welcome to Hedy's restaurant
                     ask What would you like to order?
                     echo So you would like to order 
                     print Thanks you for your order!
                     print It's on its way!
                     ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Can you think of more lines to add to your restaurant code? For example, can you ask the guests what they'd like to drink, tell them the price, or wish them a pleasant meal?

                    ## Restaurant
                    In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only echo the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                    Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the drinks!

                    ## Example Hedy Restaurant
                    ```
                    print Welcome to Hedy's restaurant!
                    print Today we're serving pizza or lasagna.
                    food is ask What would you like to eat?
                    print Great choice! The food is my favorite!
                    topping is ask Would you like meat or veggies on that?
                    print food with topping is on its way!
                    drinks is ask What would you like to drink with that?
                    print Thank you for your order.
                    print Your food and drinks will be right there!

                    In this level you can use nesting to make your restaurant more realistic and more fun!
                    For example you would ask for sauce if somebody orders fries, but you wouldn't if someone orders pizza!
                    Check out the example, and try this at your own virtual restaurant!

                    ## Restaurant
                    In this level you can make your virtual restaurant more elaborate by repeating multiple lines of code. Like this:

                    ```

                    In this level you've learned how to use the repeat command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to ask multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:

                    ```

                    In this level you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.

                    ## Example Hedy Code (Simple)
                    You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                    ```
                    print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                    print 'Here is our menu:'
                    print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    main = ask 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    if main is pizza price = 10
                    if main is lasagne price = 12
                    if main is spaghetti price = 8
                    print 'You have ordered ' main
                    print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                    ```
                    But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                    ## Example Hedy Code (Elaborate)
                    In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.
                    ```
                    print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                    print 'Here is our menu:'
                    print 'Our starters are salad, soup, or carpaccio'
                    print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    print 'Our desserts are brownie, icecream, or milkshake'
                    starter = ask 'Which starter would you like to have?'
                    main = ask 'Which main course would you like?'
                    dessert = ask 'Which dessert do you pick?'
                    price = 0
                    if starter is soup price = price + 6 else price = price + 7
                    if main is pizza price = price + 10
                    if main is lasagne price = price + 12
                    if main is spaghetti price = price + 8
                    if dessert is brownie price = price + 7
                    if dessert is icecream price = price + 5
                    if dessert is milkshake price = price + 4
                    print 'You have ordered ' starter ' , ' main ' and ' dessert
                    print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                    ```
                    ## Challenge
                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - ask how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?
                    - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                    - add a children's menu?
                    - think of other fun things to add?

                    ## Restaurant
                    In this level the if command allows you to ask your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
                    In the example below, you see that you can ask the customer if they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.

                    ## Example Hedy Code

                    print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'

                    food is ask 'What would you like to eat?'
                    print 'One ' food ', coming right up!'
                    drink is ask 'What would you like to drink with that?'
                    if drink is cola print 'Im sorry, we are out of cola!' else print 'Great choice!'
                    anything is ask 'Would you like anything else?'
                    print 'Let me repeat your order...'
                    print 'One ' food
                    if drink is cola print 'and...' else print 'One ' drink
                    if anything is no print 'Thats it!' else print 'One ' anything
                    print 'Thank you for your order and enjoy your meal!'
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Can you think of more questions to ask the customers when they are ordering, and make up different responses to their answers by using the if command?

                    ## Restaurant
                    In thsi level you have to use quotation marks when using the `print` command.
                    Can you make your code from the previous levels work in this level too by adding the quotation marks?

                    Be careful! In the previous levels apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in this level Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                    So instead of typing  `print Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `print 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                    ## Example Hedy Restaurant

                    Does your costumer have any allergies or dislikes? Then you can use the `remove`command to remove it from your menu.
                    ```
                    print Mystery milkshake

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her echo the players' answers.
                    Like this:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    ask Who are you?
                    print Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    print I see... I see...
                    echo Your name is 
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller ask 3 questions and also print them!

                    ## Example Hedy Code

                    print 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use the `repeat` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'You can ask 3 questions!'
                    repeat 3 times question = ask 'What do you want to know?'
                    answer = yes, no, maybe
                    repeat 3 times print 'My crystal ball says... ' answer at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `repeat` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of repeat command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                    age = ask 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = ask 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = ask 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    print 'You will get ...'
                    sleep
                    print kids ' kids!'

                    football = ask 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = ask 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = ask 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    print 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In thsi level you'll learn to (secretly) tip the odds in your favor, when using the fortune teller!
                    By using `if` and `else` you can make sure that you will always get a good fotune, while other people might not.
                    Check out this example to find out how.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict if youll win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person is ask 'Who are you?'
                    if person is Hedy print 'You will definitely win!' else print 'Bad luck! Someone else will win!'
                    ```

                    Replace Hedy with your own name in the last line, and Hedy will always predict that you will win the lottery and others won't!
                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers every time you run the code.
                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.

                    ## Example Hedy Code 2
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict if you will win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person is ask 'Who are you?'
                    goodanswer is Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
                    badanswer is Bad luck! Try again!, Another person will win, You lose!
                    if person is Hedy print goodanswer at random else print badanswer at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    This concept can be used to make may different programs, just be creative! For example you could create a machine that predicts that your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
                    Or you could make  Snow White's magic mirror on the wall, to tell everyone you are the fairest of them all!

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    This level has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only echo.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `at random` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    In this example the player can ask Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    print I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question is ask What do you want to know?
                    print This is what you want to know: question
                    answers is yes, no, maybe
                    print My crystal ball says...
                    sleep 2
                    print answers at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

                    ## Haunted House
                    In this level you can use the `<` and `>` symbol to introduce lives to your game.

                    ## Haunted House
                    In this level we've changed the repeat command and we've added a line to our haunted house that tells the player in which room they are.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Escape from the Haunted House!'

                            chosendoor = ask 'Which door do you choose?'
                            if chosendoor is correct_door
                                print 'No monsters here!'
                            else

                    ## Haunted House
                    In this level you can use nesting, which allows you to make the haunted house even more interactive!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'Escape from the Haunted House!'
                    player = alive
                    doors = 1, 2, 3
                    monsters = zombie, vampire, giant spider
                    repeat 3 times
                        if player is alive
                            correct_door is doors at random

                    ## Challenge
                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door en 2 wrong ones?

                    ## Haunted House
                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'Escape from the haunted house!'
                    print 'There are 3 doors in front of you...'
                    doors is 1, 2, 3
                    monsters is werewolf, mummy, vampire, zombie
                    chosen_door is ask 'Which door do you choose?'
                    print 'You chose door...' chosen_door
                    sleep
                    correct_door is doors at random
                    if chosen_door is correct_door print 'Great! Youve escaped!'
                    else print 'Oh no! You are being eaten by a...' monsters at random

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print Escape from the haunted house!
                    print There are 3 doors in front of you...
                    choice is ask Which door do you choose?
                    print You picked door ... choice
                    monsters is a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    print You see...
                    sleep
                    print monsters at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    This story is pretty straight forward, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

                    ## Change the game into a tv gameshow!
                    Lastly, we'd like to challenge you to change this game into a gameshow (like the ones on tv) where you choose a door or suitcase and it contains a big price!
                    Can you do it?

                    Congratulations! You've reached the end of level 1. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes, but Hedy has a lot more to discover. 

                    In the first level you might've notice that the `echo` command can only save one bit of information at a time. 
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence. 

                    ```
                    print Welcome at Hedy's
                    ask What would you like to eat?
                    echo So you want 
                    ask what would you like to drink?
                    echo So you want 
                    ```
                    If the player types a hamburger and coke, you can't say `so you would like a hamburger and coke`, but you have to make two separate line. 
                    Also, the `echo` command only echoes the word at the end of the sentence. So you can't say `your hamburger is coming right up!`.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    Besides, you'll learn how to work with the `at random` command, that you can use to make games. 
                    So let's go to the next level!

                start_code: "print Let's go!"

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've learned what a variable is and how you can use it to make your adventures more interactive.
                    But... that's not the only thing you can do with variables! You can also use variables to make lists.
                    And you can even let Hedy pick a random word out of a list, which allows you to make real games!
                    Take a quick look at the next level!
                start_code: "print Let's go to the next level!"

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've been practising with variables, but maybe you've come across this mistake.

                    Try to run this code:
                    ```
                    name is Sophie
                    print My name is name
                    ```
                    Of course you wanted to print `My name is Sophie` but Hedy prints `My Sophie is Sophie`. 
                    In the next level this problem is fixed by using quotation marks.

                start_code: "print Let's go to the next level!"
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you've already learned to use `at random` which made your games different every time you ran the code.
                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game.

                    In the next level you'll learn the `if` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example.
                    So let's take a peak!

                    ```
                    password is ask 'What is the correct password?'
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've reached the end of this level, so you have learned `ask` and `if`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    The next level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in the next level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
                    Go see for yourself in the next level!
                    ```
                    print 'Welcome at McHedy'
                    order is ask 'What would you like to eat?'
                    print 'You would like ' order
                    if order is hamburger price is 5
                    if order is fries price is 2
                    drinks is ask 'What would you like to drink?'
                    print 'You would like ' drinks
                    print 'That will be ' price ' dollars for your ' order ' please'
                    print 'The drinks are free in this level because Hedy cant calculate the price yet...'
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'On to the next level!'"
            6:

                    ## What's next?
                     Great job! You've reached the end of this level, which means you have practiced with `if` and `else`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
                     For example if you want to program 'Happy Birthday'

                     ```
                     print 'happy birthday to you'
                     print 'happy birthday to you'
                     print 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
                     print 'happy birthday to you'

                     ```
                     That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily in the next level has a solution with the `repeat` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.
                start_code: "print 'On to the next level!'"
            7:

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
                    the next level allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!

                    ```
                    repeat 5 times print 'In the next level you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'
                    ```

                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"
            8:

                    ## What's next?
                    Great job! You've reached the end of another level! In this level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an if of repeat command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In the next level you will be allowed to put an if inside an if, or inside a repeat command.

                    For example:
                    ```
                    answer = ask 'Would you like to go to teh next level?'
                    if answer is 'yes'
                        print 'Great! You can use the repeat commando in the if command!'
                        print 'Hooray!'
                        print 'Hooray!'
                        print 'Hooray!'
                    else
                        print 'Okay, you can stay here for a little longer!'
                    ```
                    In this code Hedy will still say 'Your drink is on its way' even if you didn't even want to drink something! In the next level this will be fixed!
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    You're doing great! In this level we still face a small problem. You have learned to repeat lines, but what if you'd want to slightly change the line.
                    For example if you want to sing the song 'if you're happy and you knwo it'

                    It would look like this:
                    ```
                    repeat 2 times
                        print 'if youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    print 'if youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'
                    print 'if youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    ```

                    If you'd also want the next verse 'stomp your feet', and the next one, and the next one, you'd have to change the code completely.
                    In the next level you'll learn the `for` command, which allows you to make a list of actions and repeat the code with another action each time!
                    Please take a look!

                    You have reached the end of this level, you're doing great! You are about to go to the next level. In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python.
                    In Python there is no `repeat` command, but there is a command that works like repeat. Are you curious to find out how to say `repeat` in Python language? Quickly go on to find out!
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Maybe you have tried using decimal numbers in your restaurant adventure. If you did, you probably noticed that Hedy didn't understand them yet and always rounded off.
                    From the next level on you can use decimal numbers.

                    Another cool feauture in the next level is that you can use mulitiple words in a variable.
                    For intance, you could already do this...
                    ```
                    name = ask 'Who is your favorite cartoon character?'
                    print 'I love watching ' name
                    ```
                    But you couldn't use multiple words in a variable like the example below. This program does not work yet in this level!
                    ```
                    show = SpongeBob SquarePants
                    print show 'is my favorite show!'
                    ```
                    Go to the next level to make this code work!
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you learned how to put two `if`commands inside each other. This works fine, but it does give you very long and unhandy codes like this one:
                    ```
                    username is ask 'What is your username?'
                    password is ask 'What is your password?'
                    if username is 'Hedy'
                        if password is 'secret'
                            print 'Welcome Hedy!'
                        else
                            print 'Access denied'
                    else
                        print 'Access denied!'
                    ```
                    In this system you have to give both the correct username and the correct password.
                    In the next level you will learn the `and` command that will make this code a ot shorter and more understandable!
                    Check it out!

                    With the program below you can calulate if you've passed a subject at school (so, a grade of six or higher).
                    You can see this code is extremely inefficient, du to the very long code in line 5.
                    All the different grades from 1 to 5 had to be programmed seperately. Lucky for you, in the next level you'll learn how to do this without this extremely long code!
                    ```
                    first_grade = ask 'What score did you get on your first test?'
                    second_grade = ask 'What score did you get on your second test?'
                    added is first_grade + second_grade
                    mean_grade is added / 2
                    if mean_grade = 1 or mean_grade = 2 or mean_grade = 3 or mean_grade = 4 or mean_grade = 5
                        print 'Oh no! You have failed the subject...'
                    else
                        print 'Great! You have passed the subject!'

                    But the code is ineffective and way too long. Also, what if the player wants to play 101 games instead of 100?
                    You can't play to infinity?
                    In the next level you will learn a command that makes all of this a lot easier!
                    ```
                    game is 'on'

                    In the next level we will grow a bit more towards real Python code. thon code. You will also learn how to match two lists together.
                    This way you can program a code in which the correct animal is matched to the right sound.
                    Because the two codes below... Are obviously nonsense!
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'
                    sounds = 'cluck', 'neigh', 'moo'
                    for animal in animals
                        print 'A ' animal ' says ' sounds at random
                    ```
                    You could also try to make it work this way, but....
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'
                    sounds = 'cluck', 'neigh', 'moo'
                    for animal in animals
                        for sound in sounds

                    In the next level it's time for a new command. You might have noticed in the previous levels that `if` and `else` sometimes aren't enough.
                    For example in this code:
                    ```
                    print 'What is for dinner tonight?'
                    options = ['pizza', 'broccoli', 'green beans']
                    chosen = options at random
                    if chosen = pizza
                        print 'Yummy! Pizza!'
                    else
                        print 'Yikes...'
                    ```
                    In this code it would be great to have 2x an `else` so you could have one option for the broccoli and one for the green beans. The next level comes with the new command `elif` that makes this possible!
